Simplify specification
======================

map:
  HEADER:
    map:
      name: [string: ]
      version: [string: ]
      sizeKB: [uint: ]

The format now is very explicit. I am specifying explicitly
that I expect a map (first line) and then explicitly listing
out the keys.

But by merely listing out the keys, am I not indicating that
I expect a list? I can use this idea to condense the above
tree specification to the one below:

HEADER:
  name: [string: ]
  version: [string: ]
  sizeKB: [uint: ]

Add richer set of checks
========================

Check for signed int, int within ranges etc.
